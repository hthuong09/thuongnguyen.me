## About Me

Hi there, I'm Thuong Nguyen, a computer geek come from Vietnam.

I'm interested in almost everything which is related to computer, programming. I'm also an "Anime Fan", you know, the one who love Anime, Japan Culture and also has weird personality.
I like Linux, [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) is best Linux Distro and [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) is the best shell. I hope you're also [the man of culture](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ah-i-see-youre-a-man-of-culture-as-well) like me ;).

## What is this site?

This site is my personal little space on THE INTERNET where I write about things happened in my daily life and I think it's interesting to share.
I'm currently learning English. So there would be lots of misspellings on my posts, don't get angry at me, please kindly let me know by shoot me an email or other social sites in the footer.
